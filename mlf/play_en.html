<h2>Background</h2>

This is a fangame of <i><a href="https://atelier.games/resleriana_rw/us/">Atelier Resleriana: The Red Alchemist &amp; The White Guardian.</a></i>

The kemomimi girl is named Rias. She is a novice alchemist at the start of the game.

Please watch over her. The game is mostly about observing her daily life; occasionally you may gently nudge her to do something, but avoid disturbing her while she is concentrating.

<h2>Goal</h2>

There is no explicit win condition or ending in this game.<p>

<img src="images/level_money.jpg" width=20%>
<ul>
  <li><b>Level</b>:<br>
	Rias’s skill level improves when she successfully produces higher-quality items.
  <li><b>Money</b>:<br>
	She earns money by selling items. Higher-quality items fetch higher prices.
</ul>

<h2>Save</h2>

The game automatically saves your progress in your web browser or on your PC.
Even when you're not looking at Rias (when the game is not running), she's still getting things done.

<h2>How to Play</h2>

<ul>
  <li><b>Mouse/Touch</b>:<br>
	Click or tap a piece of furniture to nudge her into performing its action.
  <li><b>Keyboard</b>:
	<ul>
	  <li><b>←→</b>:
		Move the cursor to select a piece of furniture.
	  <li><b>Space</b>:
		Nudge her into performing the action associated with the currently selected furniture.
	</ul>
  <li><b>Controller</b>:
	<ul>
	  <li><b>←→</b>:
		Move the cursor to select a piece of furniture.
	  <li><b>A/B</b>:
		Nudge her into performing the action associated with the currently selected furniture.
	</ul>
</ul>

<h2>Action</h2>

<ul>
  <li><b>Synthesizing</b>:<br>
	<img src="images/cauldron.jpg" align="right" width="20%">
	This is the action for the cauldron.
	Rias synthesizes a neutralizer in the cauldron. Her skill and concentration influence the likelihood of producing a higher-quality neutralizer. Successfully creating high-quality neutralizers can contribute to increasing her skill.
	<br clear="all">
  <li><b>Short break</b>:<br>
	<img src="images/desk.jpg" align="right" width="10%">
	This is the action for the desk.
	Rias prepares herself for the next task. Maybe she will choose synthesizing or sleeping.
	<br clear="all">
  <li><b>Reading</b>:<br>
	<img src="images/bookshelf.jpg" align="right" width="10%">
	This is the action for the bookshelf.
	Studying books improves Rias’s skill.
	<br clear="all">
  <li><b>Cleaning</b>:<br>
	<img src="images/broom.jpg" align="right" width="10%">
	This is the action for the broom.
	She tidies the room and collects stray neutralizers. Collected items can be sold for money. Cleaning also has a gentle positive effect on her health.
	<br clear="all">
  <li><b>Sleeping</b>:<br>
	<img src="images/sofa.jpg" align="right" width="10%">
	This is the action for the sofa.
	Rias sleeps to recover stamina.
	<br clear="all">
</ul>

<h2>Status Description</h2>

<ul>
  <li><img src="images/stamina.jpg"> <b>Stamina</b>:<br>
	When stamina is very low, Rias may refuse or ignore action commands.
  <li><img src="images/health.jpg"> <b>Health</b>:<br>
	Low health reduces the rate at which stamina recovers.
  <li><img src="images/concentration.jpg"> <b>Concentration</b>:<br>
	Higher concentration increases the probability of better synthesis results.
</ul>

<h2>Hint</h2>

At the beginning, Cleaning and Reading improves Rias's skill.
